# AegisMint Token Control - Testing Guide

## Overview
This guide provides comprehensive step-by-step instructions for testing the AegisMint Token Control system. The system consists of two main components:
1. **Desktop Applications** (Mint and Token Control) - Windows desktop applications for token management
2. **Web Application** (Governance Portal) - Browser-based portal for administration and governance

## Prerequisites

### Required Applications
- **Mint Desktop App**: Windows application for initial token setup and share generation. Can be uninstalled after completing the token creation process.
- **Token Control Desktop App**: Windows application for token operations. Can be deployed on multiple computers using shares generated by the Mint application.
- **Web Browser**: Latest version of Chrome, Edge, or Firefox
- **Internet Connection**: Active internet connection required to communicate with the governance server

### Test User Accounts

- **Admin Portal**: For managing desktops and users (OTP authentication required via authenticator app)
  - Admin credentials: admin@example.com / ChangeMe123!
- **Governance Users**: Two accounts for testing the multi-approval process (OTP authentication required via authenticator app)
  - Primary Governance User: gov@example.com / GovPass123!
  - Secondary Governance User: new2@example.com / finebyme@400users

### System URLs
- **Admin and Governance Portal**: https://apkserve.com/governance

2. Enter "Number of Tokens" (total supply)
3. Enter "Number of Decimal Places" (typically 18)
4. Enter "Number of Shares" (total shares to generate)
5. Enter "Number Needed to Generate Key" (threshold for key recovery)
6. Click the "Mint Token" button

**Expected Results**:
- Deployment progress indicator appears
- File dialog prompts for share save location
- Deployment process completes within 1-2 minutes
- "Contract Address" field populates with the deployed token contract address
